    <h3>Article: 1</h3>
    <p><em>Rangamati,</em> town, southeastern Bangladesh. It is situated in the Chittagong Hills region near the Karnaphuli River. <small>Rangamati is connected by road and river steamer with the city of Chittagong . The town is a rice-milling and cotton-weaving centre and an agricultural market. It has a hospital and a government college affiliated with the University of Chittagong</small>. <p>Chakma, largest of the indigenous populations of Bangladesh, also settled in parts of northeastern India and in Myanmar (Burma). Their Indo-Aryan language has its own script, but the Chakma writing system has given way, for the most part, to Bengali script.The earliest history of the Chakma people is not known. Some suggest that they migrated from the ancient Indian kingdom of Magadha (what is now west-central Bihar state) to Arakan (now part of Myanmar) and then to the region the British would later designate as the Chittagong Hill Tracts. They began farming bamboo, rice, cotton, and vegetables in the Chittagong Hills, and the majority of Chakmas—numbering about 300,000—remained there into the 21st century. They live in close proximity to less-populous tribes such as the Marma (Magh, or Mogh), Tripura (Tipra), and Tenchungya (Tanchangya)..</p> </p>

    <p>The warmest months in Tripura are April and May, when maximum daily temperatures in the lowlands average in the low 90s F (about 33 °C), and minimum temperatures average in the mid-70s F (about 23 °C). The coolest month is January, with temperatures typically rising from the low 50s F (about 10 °C) into the upper 70s F (about 25 °C) daily. Throughout the year, it is cooler in the hill regions.

     <p></p>   Annually, the state registers about 80 inches (2,000 mm) of rainfall, most of which is brought by the monsoon, which generally blows from June to September. North-central Tripura usually receives the most rainfall; the southwestern region typically receives the least. About half of Tripura’s land area is under forest cover. One of the most notable types of trees of the state’s forests is sal, a valuable tropical hardwood. There also are large tracts of bamboo, some species of which are believed to be endemic to the state.</p>

    <p> <h3>Resources and power</h3>
        Tripura has extensive resources of natural gas that in the early 21st century remained largely untapped. The bulk of the state’s energy is provided by several gas- and diesel-powered thermal plants. There is also a small hydroelectric station on the Gumti River</p>

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            Tripura’s hilly topography has continued to impair transportation and communication within the state. Moreover, with Bangladesh bordering the state on three sides, Tripura is virtually isolated from India. There is, however, a national highway that passes through the state, linking the capital city of Agartala in the west with the state of Mizoram in the northeast and Bangladesh in the southeast. Larger towns of Tripura are connected through a network of major roads. The North-East Frontier Railway of India’s national rail network serves several cities in Tripura. Most rivers carry boat traffic, but this is generally for local transport. Agartala is linked by air to several cities in India, including Kolkata (Calcutta) in West Bengal, Guwahati in Assam, and the national capital of New Delhi.
